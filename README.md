# NewsExtention

## How to set up this extension in developer mode
1. open extensions in chrome
2. make sure "developer mode" is on in the top right
3. click "load unpacked" and select /src/ directory from forked repo

* remember to hit the reload button on this page after making changes

## Current approach
Right now, manifest.json overrides any new tab page with /newpage/. Basically all development will go in this folder. More info can be found here https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/override.
